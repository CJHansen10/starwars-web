This web app is meant to take a number from 1-6 and display a star wars movie from the orginal trilogy and the prequel trilogy. The numbers equal when the movie was 
released in chronological order. Such that 1=A New Hope 2=Empire Strikes Back 3=Return of the Jedi 4=The Phantom Menace 5=Attack of the Clones 6=Revenge of the Sith. 
Once a number is inputted the API will load for about 10-20 seconds and show what movie you picked based on the chronological order. Then it will print out some of the
main characters that were in that movie.
